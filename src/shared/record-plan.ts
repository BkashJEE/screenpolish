/**
 * A recording plan: what an agent proposes before anything is recorded.
 *
 * You say what the video is for; an agent you already use answers with the
 * angle to record, how long, a shot list, the look, and the cards around it.
 * This module builds the question, pulls the plan out of the answer and
 * checks every field, because the answer is a model's text: anything missing
 * or out of range is dropped or clamped here rather than trusted.
 *
 * Pure, so the prompt and the parsing are tested without an agent.

Plan the recording the user describes.

Don't use tools; just answer.

What this machine can record:
Screens:
${screens}
Windows:
${windows}
Microphone: ${context.hasMic ? 'available' : 'none'}. Webcam: ${context.hasWebcam ? 'available' : 'none'}.

Conversation so far:
